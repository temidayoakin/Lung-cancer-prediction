# Lung-cancer-prediction
Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. When cancer starts in the lungs, it is called lung cancer. Lungs are two spongy organs in the chest that takes in oxygen during inhalation and releases carbon dioxide during exhalation. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.

### Types of lung cancer
There are 2 main types of lung cancer.

### Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
About 80% to 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. These subtypes, which start from different types of lung cells, are grouped together as NSCLC because their treatment and prognoses (outlook) are often similar.

#### Adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinomas start in the cells that would normally secrete substances such as mucus.
This type of lung cancer occurs mainly in people who smoke or used to smoke, but it is also the most common type of lung cancer seen in people who don't smoke. It is more common in women than in men, and it is more likely to occur in younger people than other types of lung cancer.

#### Squamous cell carcinoma
Squamous cell carcinomas start in squamous cells, which are flat cells that line the inside of the airways in the lungs. They are often linked to a history of smoking and tend to be found in the central part of the lungs, near a main airway (bronchus).

#### Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma
Large cell carcinoma can appear in any part of the lung. It tends to grow and spread quickly, which can make it harder to treat. 

### Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
About 10% to 15% of all lung cancers are SCLC. It is sometimes called oat cell cancer. 
This type of lung cancer tends to grow and spread faster than NSCLC. In most people with SCLC, the cancer has already spread beyond the lungs at the time it is diagnosed.

### Other types of lung tumors
Along with the main types of lung cancer, other tumors can occur in the lungs.

#### Lung carcinoid tumors
Carcinoid tumors of the lung account for fewer than 5% of lung tumors. Most of these grow slowly. For more information about these tumors, see Lung Carcinoid Tumor.

#### Other lung tumors
Other types of lung cancer such as adenoid cystic carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas, as well as benign lung tumors such as hamartomas are rare. These are treated differently from the more common lung cancers and are not discussed here.

#### Cancers that spread to the lungs
Cancers that start in other organs (such as the breast, pancreas, kidney, or skin) can sometimes spread (metastasize) to the lungs, but these are not lung cancers.

The effectiveness of cancer prediction system helps the people to know their cancer risk with low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status. The data is collected from the website online lung cancer prediction system.
